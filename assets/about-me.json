  "content": "This past summer I interned at Coursera where I was a software engineer intern on the content monetization team. I primarily worked on the backend with Java, gRPC, Scala, and MySQL. This upcoming winter, I will be interning at BDO Digital as a software developer intern. Outside of work, I love doing hackathon competitions because of the collaboration and new experiences that I get to share with others. This past year I competed in about 9 hackathons. When I'm not programming, I'm usually running or playing basketball."
